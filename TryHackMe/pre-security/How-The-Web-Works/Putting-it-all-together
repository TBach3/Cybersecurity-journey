## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Load Balancers are multiple servers for a website that has high traffic ensuring the website doesn't become overloaded with traffic
- CDN (Contact Delivery Network) is a place to host static files from your website across multiple servers from around the world and when requested the
closest physical location is the server that connected
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) protect the website from hacking or DoS attacks
